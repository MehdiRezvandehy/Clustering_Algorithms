# Clustering Algorithms

Most application of Machine Learning are based on supervised learning (labels are available); however, there may be vast majority of the available data without labels. It would be great if a model can be automatically trained without needing human supervision. Clustering or cluster analysis is an unsupervised machine learning technique, which groups the unlabelled dataset. It can be defined as "A way of grouping the data points into different clusters, consisting of similar data points. The objects with the possible similarities remain in a group that has less or no similarities with another group."In this notebook, different clustering techniques including K-means, DBSCAN, Spectral Clustering, Agglomerative Clustering, Gaussian Mixture models will be applied for synthetic and realistic data. The pros and cons of each technique will be discussed.
